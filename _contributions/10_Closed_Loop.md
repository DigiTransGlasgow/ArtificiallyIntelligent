# Closed Loop
## Jake Elwes

AI algorithms can be taught not just a visual language but also the ability to describe images verbally. So what happens when an AI that interprets images in words converses with another AI that interprets words in images? 

Are the possibilities of comprehension and miscomprehension all that different from what happens when two humans, perhaps from different cultures, meet? Elwes works with two different algorithms to enable us to eavesdrop on this eerie conversation. 46 Jake Elwes

The conversation which shifts between the logical, to the enigmatic to the frankly incomprehensible, produces constant frissons of surprise and in the end a profound sense of displacement from oneâ€™s own settled perceptual self.
